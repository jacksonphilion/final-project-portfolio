You can directly paste the embed HTML code into your Quarto markdown.\nThink of your front page like a pitch. You’re looking to give the reader a quick summary of what your project is and invite them to check it out in more detail.\nHost the portfolio website using Github pages. The most seamless way is to keep all the Quarto source docs inside a docs folder of your project Github repository and run quarto publish from there to render to Github pages. As a reminder, instructions on how to render can be found here."
